<h3>- What?</h3>
  I have a Dell Inspiron N5110 laptop and I have decided to take it a part and make a pc out of it.

<h3> Why the hell am I doing that ?!!!!</h3> 
Well short answer cause it is fun, long one is that I have been using this laptop for 4 years and recently it got sick. Keyboard and touchpad are dead, battery is no longer working, and lastly an over heating problem that is Driving me crazy "I tried every thing no viable solution for it". Though I have all of these issues, it is still     can perform better than I expect "with few upgrads that I made before",So I have decided to salvage what I can and create a pc "Hopfully gaming pc" out of it. I loved this model, it served me well and this is is how I will pay it back :) <3.


<h3>How ??</h3>
Salvage the Motherboard,and everything attached to it "HDD,CD ROOM", put it in external case with better colling system "I am thinking 4 fans 2 on each side", then attach 24 inch screen to it.

I am creating this repo to serve as a guide for any one who want to do the same, cause I can't find much about what I am doing now....And yes I fucking googled.
